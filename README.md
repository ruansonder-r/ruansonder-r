### 💻 A Bit About Me

I'm a full-stack developer with a love for building things that matter for underserved communities/peoples, i've sofar worked in companies that helped me accomplish that goal.

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
- 📸 Capturing moments through the lens of my camera.
- 💡 Tinkering with microcontrollers and shitty terminal apps.
- ⌨️ Pretending like my **Ergo Split keyboard** was a project for my health and not just a fun side project.
